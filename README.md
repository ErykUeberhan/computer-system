## 📋 General info 📋
Computer-system app is symulation of system on webpage. That allows me to add everything what I want like Spotify API
or weather widget. It's easy way to show my simple projects in one place. You can allow to get your localization to show the weather near your place, log to spotify account and listen your last playlist on widget (if there is a uri error you need to play song on official spotify app, stop it and now you can play music on page). Also I prepare a window functionalities like resize, minimize or maximize. You can open a window by clicking folder icon or Spotify icon in bottom menu. In left menu by blue slider you can change a brightness of screen.
